**TL;DR:** Traditional Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems rely on first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling. When longer requests block shorter ones in the queue, this creates a cascade of delays that severely impacts overall system latency. With exact output lengths being unpredictable in LLM generation, optimizing scheduling has remained challenging. We developed a novel *learning to rank* approach that predicts the relative ranking of output lengths, enabling a more efficient Shortest Job First-like scheduling policy. This scheduling approach reduced chatbot latency by 6.9x compared to traditional FCFS scheduling.

## Head-of-Line Blocking in LLM Serving 

LLMs have become critical infrastructure for many Internet services, powering applications used by millions daily. As demand grows, serving LLMs efficiently on GPU clusters becomes essential to handle the sheer volume of user requests. For applications like chatbots, this requires minimizing user-perceived latency while maintaining high throughput to support as many concurrent users as possible.

Traditional first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling, a common strategy in LLM serving, falls short under **high workloads** due to Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking. In FCFS, sometimes long-running requests monopolize the system, forcing shorter, potentially quicker requests to wait unnecessarily. This not only increases user-perceived latency but also hinders overall system efficiency. As illustrated in Figure 1, a single long request can significantly delay others, compounding performance bottlenecks.

It is well-established that algorithms like shortest-job-first (SJF) and the preemptive version shortest-remaining-time-first (SRTF) minimize the average latency, as they prioritize shorter tasks. However, SJF/SRTF are seldom implemented in LLM services because they require requests to be ordered by their remaining generation lengths, which is traditionally assumed to be difficult or impossible to know ahead of time in existing systems.

{{< image src="img/HOL.png" alt="HOL" width="120%" title="Figure 1: A long request can block short requests and introduce severe HOL blocking and high latency. We assume there is no prefill time, and the system takes 1 second to generate 1 token. With a First-come-first-serve (FCFS) schedule, the long request *R0*, which arrives first and takes 10 seconds to generate 10 tokens, will block subsequent shorter requests *R1* and *R2* for 10 seconds. Hence the latencies of *R0*,  *R1*, and *R2* are $10 / 10 = 1, (10 + 2) / 2 = 6, (10+2+1)/1=13 \mbox{ s / token}$, respectively, perceived by users, with an average latency of $(1+6+13)/3 = 6.67 \mbox{ s / token}$. By contrast, prioritizing shortest requests yields an average latency of $(1.3+1.5+1)/3=1.27 \mbox{ s / token}$ -- a $5.3\times$ reduction in average latency.">}}


## LLM Scheduling by Learning To Rank

### Accurate Rankings, Not Exact Lengths, Enable SJF/SRTF-like Scheduling

An LLM generates text through autoregressive decoding, producing one token at a time based on all previously generated tokens. The model continues this sequential generation until it produces a special End-of-Sequence (EOS) token, which signals the completion of the response. Due to this autoregressive nature, we cannot anticipate the EOS token's timing, making exact generation lengths unpredictable at the start of processing.

While SJF/SRTF scheduling traditionally are considered to require exact job length information, we demonstrate that precise lengths aren't necessary - accurate prediction of **generation length rankings** is sufficient for effective SJF/SRTF-like LLM scheduling. This insight enables us to approximate SJF/SRTF scheduling by using these rankings to reduce HOL blocking and achieve lower latency in LLM serving.

Our experiments validate this approach through two key metrics. As shown in Figure 2a, our ranking-based scheduler achieves a normalized waiting time that's 0.5x of FCFS, while remaining only 0.2x away from the optimal SRTF scheduler that has access to perfect length information. To quantify ranking accuracy, we use [Kendall's tau correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_rank_correlation_coefficient), which measures how well our predicted rankings align with the true generation lengths. Figure 2b demonstrates that higher Kendall's tau correlations (more accurate ranking predictions) indicate more accurate predictions compared to the oracle rankings (SJF/SRTF), directly translating to lower per-token latency in the LLM serving system.

(b): Analysis revealed that higher Kendallâ€™s Tau correlation coefficients were associated with reduced latency. This finding was validated using the ShareGPT dataset with the Llama-3-8B model.">}}

To achieve accurate generation length rankings, we leverage Learning to Rank (LTR), a machine learning approach that allows us to predict the relative ordering of completion times for a batch of prompts and use these predictions for efficient scheduling. We introduce it in the following section.

### Learning to Rank

Learning to Rank is a supervised machine learning paradigm that trains models to generate rankings of items based on their characteristics. Among the various ranking methodologies, listwise approaches stand out by directly optimizing the ordering of entire sequences, offering advantages over pointwise and pairwise methods that may miss important contextual relationships between items. A notable example is [ListMLE](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1390156.1390306), a listwise ranking loss function central to our study.

Let $y$ denote the correct (ground truth) ranking and $x$ denote the set of queries to be ranked. The scoring function $g$ maps from the input space $x$ to predicted rankings $y$.
ListMLE minimizes the likelihood function defined as $\mathcal{\phi}(g(x),y)=-\log P\left(y \mid x ; g\right)$, where

$P(y \mid x ; g)=\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{\exp \left(g\left(x_{y(i)}\right)\right)}{\sum_{k=i}^n \exp \left(g\left(x_{y(k)}\right)\right)} $

Here, $P(y \mid x ; g)$ represents the probability of permutation $y$ given input $x$ and scoring function $g$. $x_{y(i)}$ denotes the element in $x$ corresponding to the $i$-th position in permutation $y$. Intuitively, this formulation captures how well our scoring function $g$ predicts the true ordering $y$ of inputs $x$. The loss function $\mathcal{\phi}(g(x),y)$ represents the negative log-likelihood of observing the correct ranking $y$, where a lower value indicates better prediction accuracy. By minimizing this loss, we train the model to effectively predict the relative positioning of elements in the list.

### Method

Our scheduling algorithm leverages the learning to rank to efficiently process requests, as illustrated in Figure 3 and detailed in Algorithm 1 in the paper. The scheduler operates through three key steps:

- A ranking model ($P$) predicts generation lengths for newly arrived requests in each iteration
- All pending requests are sorted based on these predictions
- A running batch is formed following this sorted order, while respecting memory and batch size constraints

This ranking-based scheduler operates at the iteration level, making it compatible with established LLM serving techniques like [continuous batching](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/presentation/yu) and [PagedAttention](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600006.3613165). To prevent long requests from being perpetually delayed, we've incorporated starvation prevention mechanisms, which we discuss in detail below.

{{< image src="img/llm-ltr.png" alt="overview" width="80%" title="Figure 3: Overview of the method.">}}


### Training Length Ranking Predictor

For our predictor ($P$), we leverage [OPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068), a language model capable of processing natural language prompts. Specifically, we use a small variant (OPT-125M) and append an MLP to map its hidden states to ranking scores. While previous methods used [classification with bucketing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06000) to predict output lengths, we found this approach both challenging and unnecessary - relative rankings are sufficient. 

Our training process uses prompt-ranking pairs collected from actual serving batches. We analyzed the predictor's sensitivity to batch size (Table 5 in the paper) and selected batches of 64 prompts. For each batch, we record both the prompts and their corresponding rankings based on observed generation lengths. After collecting 10K such pairs from real-world serving, we can train the model in less than 5 minutes, making it practical for deployment. This learning-to-rank approach enables the model to directly order prompts by their expected generation length according to the real-world serving data distribution.

### Starvation Prevention

While SJF/SRTF scheduling can improve overall latency, it risks causing starvation for long requests, where users wait excessively for responses. Unlike previous fairness designs that focus on [inter-client fairness](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi24/presentation/sheng), we propose a $max\_waiting\_time$ metric to evaluate fairness at the per-request level, directly reflecting individual user satisfaction. This metric considers both Time To First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) in LLM serving:

$max\_waiting\_time = max(TTFT, max(TPOT))$

This metric characterizes the maximum wait time between receiving new tokens after submitting a request. A larger $max\_waiting\_time$ indicates longer waiting periods, signaling more severe starvation.

To mitigate starvation, our algorithm implements three mechanisms:
- Increment a request's starvation count when it isn't executed in a scheduling step
- Promote a request's priority by allocating "quantum" execution time once its starvation count reaches a threshold
- Maintain the elevated priority until the request exhausts its quantum

This approach prevents request-level starvation, improves max_waiting_time, and enhances user satisfaction, as our experiments (paper Â§5.5) demonstrate.


##  Experiments

### Main results

Figure 4 compares the latency of our ranking method against four baselines using two real-world datasets (ShareGPT and LMSYS-Chat-1M) across increasing arrival rates. We evaluated these methods on two latest models: LLaMA3 8B and 70B. At 64 requests/second, our method achieves up to 6.9x lower mean latency than FCFS and 1.5x-1.9x lower than Perception Only (PO).

Both [Multi-Level Feedback Queue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05920) (MLFQ, a traditional system scheduling approach) and [PO](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3666122.3668981) (which asks the LLM itself to predict its generation length) suffer from severe HOL blocking because they require initial processing of all requests: PO must run requests through the LLM, while MLFQ needs to process requests before assigning priority levels. The [classification approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06000), which predicts request lengths by assigning them to discrete buckets, optimizes for accuracy rather than ranking, and shows sub-optimal performance in both approximating SJF and end-to-end evaluation.

### Comparing Ranking Predictors

We show that the accuracy of the targeted classification method is suboptimal for LLM scheduling. Table 1 compares the prediction ability of the classification method with different bucket sizes. We evaluate the classification metric (i.e., accuracy) for the classification method and the ranking metric (i.e., Kendall's Tau) for all methods on the same randomly sampled test set. This approach faces inherent limitations: with a small number of buckets, multiple queries with different length characteristics may be grouped together, reducing the granularity of length-based ordering. Conversely, using many buckets makes the classification problem increasingly difficult as each bucket contains fewer training examples. This creates a challenging trade-off between classification granularity and model performance.

We also evaluate the end-to-end performance of these methods. The 'Lat.' column shows the mean latency to process 2k bursts of requests as in Â§5.2 in the paper. The 'Time' column shows the time to generate 1k synthetic data as in Â§5.3 in the paper. A method with a higher Kendall's Tau correlates with lower latency, as proposed in Â§3 in the paper. The time to generate 1k synthetic data is less related to Kendall's Tau, as a high Tau with a large bucket size does not necessarily mean the predictor can correctly select the shortest requests.

PO achieves higher Kendall's Tau on the LMSYS-Chat-1M dataset. However, it needs to use the LLM itself to process all requests and generate a few tokens first for prediction, which introduces a very large HOL overhead compared to light predictor-based methods, despite its good performance in terms of Kendall's Tau. In all other settings, our proposed ranking method outperforms all other methods in terms of ranking metrics and end-to-end performance.   

{{< image src="img/compare-all-ltr.png" alt="compare" width="100%" title="Table 1: Ranking prediction ability with different classification (Class. in table) settings (i.e., different bucket sizes) for Llama-3-70B. Lat. column shows the mean latency processing a burst of 2k requests for chatbot serving. Time column shows the time to generate 1k requests for synthetic data generation. Optimal Prediction is using the generation length of one random seed to predict the length of another seed. Note that the p-values of Kendall's Tau are below a given significance level (i.e., 1e-3) in all settings.">}}

### Overhead of the predictor

The predictor adds minimal overhead - less than 2% additional processing time across all settings. We use a 350M parameter predictor for the 70B model and a 125M predictor for the 8B model. While request processing involves both prefill and decode steps, the OPT predictor only performs prefill operations. The overhead increases with longer context lengths, which explains the higher overhead observed on the ShareGPT dataset.
